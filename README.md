# SocialNetworkMining

This project performs the following tasks on Youtube network:

1- Clustering (KMeans and Louvain)

2- Embedding (PCA, Random Walk, SVD)

3- Link Prediction (Adamic Adar and Jaccard Index)

4- Shortest path finding (Disjkstra)

To run the project properly, you need to include the dataset in your execution folder. 

You can set the variable k in the project to limit the number of nodes to explore (default is 300)

This project applies Scikit-Network library to execute the abovementioned tasks on Youtube dataset.
